# SAL 603 Final Project
For my final project, I would like to focus on how the 3 point shot has impacted defensive metrics like blocks, defensive rebounds, and steals, in the NBA. I intend to look within a period of 10 seasons to view how the 3s growing popularity in the league has change a team's defensive objective.
Data is expect to be gathered from Basketball Reference starting from 1999 to 2019.
